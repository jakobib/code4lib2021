## Unification of vocabulary services in BARTOC

Jakob Voß et. al.

The terminology registry BARTOC collects information about several thousand library classifications, thesauri, ontologies and other controlled vocabularies. In addition to improved visibility and findability via vocabulary description, BARTOC includes more and more means to also access vocabulary content. The poster will show how
BARTOC becomes a hub of vocabulary services for unified browsing, searching, and reuse of concepts and their identifiers. The access is managed via mapping existing services and formats such as Skosmos, SKOS and custom terminology APIs to a common JSON based data format. All methods are available in a JavaScript library so access to controlled vocabularies can be added to other web applications without need to dive into multiple API specifications.

## Beyond passworts: a login-server for distributed identification

Jakob Voß et. al.

Managing user accounts and credentials is tiresome for both users and providers of web applications. We will present a login-server that allows user to reuse accounts at common identity providers (GitHub, ORCID, Wikimedia...) or custom databases (e.g LDAP) to prove their identity via single-sign-on. The login-server is mainly based on passport.js and ready to be reused as Open Source. We will show why and how it is used in web applications at common library network (GBV).
